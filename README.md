In this excercise I used three ways to create a chessboard: <br>

1. float <br>
2. inline-block (this one is a bit different one that the rest, but it's on purpose)<br>
3. flexbox <br><br>

I also used two chessboards to practise JS (Projects 1-3 from the course "Programowanie w JavaScript" by Bartek Borowczyk - it was my own way to practise them)
